Some [Am]things in life are [D7]bad
they can [G]really make you [Em]mad
o[Am]ther things just m[D7]ake you swear and [G]curse[Em]
when you're [Am]chewing on life's [D7]gristle
don't [G]grumble - give a wh[Em]istle
and th[A7]is'll helps things turn out for the [D]best

\omkv{
And a[G]lways l[Em]ook on the br[Am]ight s[D7]ide of l[G]ife
([Em]fløjt...[Am]...[D7]...)
a[G]lways l[Em]ook on the l[Am]ight s[D7]ide of l[G]ife
([Em]fløjt...[Am]...[D7]...)
}

If [Am]life seems jolly [D7]rotten
there's [G]something you've for[Em]gotten
and [Am]that's to l[D7]augh and smile and dance [G]and sing[Em]
when you are [Am]feeling in the [D7]dumps
don't [G]be silly [Em]chums
just pu[A7]rse your lips and whistle that's the [D]thing

\omkv{
And a[G]lways l[Em]ook on the br[Am]ight s[D7]ide of l[G]ife
([Em]fløjt...[Am]...[D7]...)
a[G]lways l[Em]ook on the br[Am]ight s[D7]ide of l[G]ife
([Em]fløjt...[Am]...[D7]...)
}

For [Am]life is quite ab[D7]surd
and [G]death's the final [Em]word
you[Am] must always [D7]face the curtain [G]with a bow[Em]
for[A7]get about your [D7]sin
give the [G]audience a [Em]grin
enj[A7]oy it, it's your last chance any[D]how


\omkv{
So al[G]ways l[Em]ook on the br[Am]ight s[D7]ide of d[G]eath
([Em]fløjt...[Am]...[D7]...)
j[G]ust be[Em]fore you dr[Am]aw your ter[D7]minal br[G]eath.
([Em]fløjt...[Am]...[D7]...)
}

L[Am]ife's a piece of [D7]shit
wh[G]en you look at [Em]it
li[Am]fe's a laugh and de[D7]ath's a joke - [G]it's true[Em]
you [Am]see it's all a [D7]show
keep [G]them laughing as you [Em]go
just re[A7]member that the last laugh is on [D]you

\omkv{
and a[G]lways l[Em]ook on the br[Am]ight s[D7]ide of l[G]ife
([Em]fløjt...[Am]...[D7]...)
a[G]lways l[Em]ook on the r[Am]ight s[D7]ide of l[G]ife.
