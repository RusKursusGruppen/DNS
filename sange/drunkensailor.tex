Put him in the longboat 'till he's sober ...     

Keep him there and make him bale 'er ...     

Give him a dose of salt and water ...     

Shave his belly with a rusty razor ...     

Put him in a bed with the captain's daughter ...     

There she goes, swinging through the rigging,
There she goes, swinging through the rigging,
There she goes, swinging through the rigging,
Ear-lye in the morning.

\omkv{
She looks like an orangutan,
She looks like an orangutan,
She looks like an orangutan,
Swinging through the rigging.

Jeg vil ha' en kvinde der kan babbe kogle
Tideligt om morgenen.

Hu hej, sikke en rejsning
Hu hej, sikke en rejsning
Tideligt om morgenen.
